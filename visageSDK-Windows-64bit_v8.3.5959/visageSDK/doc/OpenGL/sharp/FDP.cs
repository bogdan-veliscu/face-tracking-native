	/// <summary>
	/// Feature points of a face.
	/// This class is a container for facial feature points as defined by <a href="../MPEG-4 FBA Overview.pdf">MPEG-4 FBA standard</a>, as well as
	/// some additional feature points. Feature points are identified by their group (for example, feature points of
	/// the nose constitute their own group) and index. So, for example, the tip of the chin belongs to group 2 and has
	/// index 1, so it is identified as point 2.1. The identification of all feature points is
	/// illustrated in the image below:
	/// \image html "mpeg-4_fba.png" "Facial Feature Points (FP)"
	/// \image html "half_profile_physical_2d.png" "Visible/Physical contour"
	/// Groups 2 - 11 contain feature points defined according to the
	/// MPEG-4 FBA standard,
	/// and group 12 and 14 contain additional feature points that are not part of the MPEG-4 standard (12.1, 12.5, 12.6, 12.7, 12.8, 12.9, 12.10, 12.11, 12.12), (14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.4).
	/// <h4>Face contour - group 13 and group 15</h4>
	/// Face contour is available in two versions: the visible contour (points 13.1 - 13.17) and the physical contour (points 15.1 - 15.17).
	/// The physical contour is the set of 16 equally spaced points running from one ear to another, following the outer edge of cheeks and the jaw. Depending on face rotation, points on the physical contour may not always be visible; however, our algorithm maps them on the 3D model of the face and estimates the invisible points. Therefore all points of the physical contour are always available, regardless of their visibility, in both 3D and 2D (featurePoints2D, featurePoints3D, featurePoints3DRelative). The 2D points are obtained by projection from the 3D points, and they may not correspond to the points on the visible contour.
	/// 
	/// The visible contour is the set of 16 equally spaced points running along the edges of the visible part of the face in the image, starting at the height of ears. Thus, in a frontal face the visible contour runs from one ear, along the jaw and chin, to the other ear; in a semi-profile face it runs from the visible ear, along the jaw and chin, then along the cheek on the far side of the face; in full profile it runs from the ear, along the jaw, then up along the mouth and nose. The points on the visible contour are obtained directly by detection/tracking, and they are available only in 2D (featurePoints2D). Please note that point 13.17 is exactly identical to point 2.1 (2.1 point exists for MPEG-4 compatibility purposes).
	/// <h4>Stability and accuracy of the contours</h4>
	/// The points on the visible contour are among the most difficult to detect/track, and their accuracy is lower than that of eyes or mouth points; they are also more noisy (jittery). The points on the physical contour are obtained from the fitted 3D model of the face. This stabilises them so there is considerably less jitter. In general, it is recommended to use the physical contour.
	///
	/// 
	/// FDP class stores feature point information. It also provides functions for reading and writing the feature point data as files,
	/// as well as certain auxiliary members that deal with normalization of feature points and their classification according to
	/// facial region.
	///
	/// The actual data for each feature point is stored in the structure FeaturePoint. One such structure is allocated for each feature point. To
	/// access a feature point, use one of the functions getFP() that access a feature point by its group and index expressed either as integer values, or as a string (e.g. "2.1").
	/// Functions getFPPos() are available as a convenience, to access the feature point coordinates directly, without first accessing the FeaturePoint structure.
	///
	/// The feature points may relate to a particular 3D model. In such a case it is interesting to know, for each feature point, to 
	/// which vertex it belongs. For this purpose, the FeaturePoint structure contains the mesh identifier
	/// and vertex index that correspond to the feature point and the FDP class provides functions to access this data.
	/// 
	/// <b><i>Left-right convention</i></b>
	///	 
	/// References to left and right in feature point definitions are given from the perspective of the face itself so "right eye" 
	/// can be imagined as "my right eye". When referring to feature points in an image, it is assumed that image is taken by camera and 
	/// not mirrored so "right eye" is on the left in the image, as shown in feature points illustration above.
