	/// <summary> VisageFaceRecognition class contains a face recognition algorithm capable of measuring similarity between human faces and recognizing a person's identity from frontal facial images (yaw angle approximately from -20 to 20 degrees). 
	/// Similarity between two faces is calculated as difference between their face descriptors and returned as a value between 0 (no similarity) and 1 (maximum similarity).
	///
	/// The face descriptor is a condensed representation of a face. It is an array of short values. The dimension of the array is obtained using getDescriptorSize() function, from now on in the text referred to as DESCRIPTOR_SIZE. For any two faces, the distance between descriptors is a measure of their similarity. 
	///
	/// For the purpose of face recognition, faces are stored in a gallery. The gallery is an array of face descriptors, with a corresponding array of names, so that the gallery may contain n descriptors and a corresponding name for each descriptor. To perform recognition, the face descriptor extracted from the input image is then compared with face descriptors from the gallery and the similarity between the input face descriptor and all face descriptors from the gallery is calculated in order to find the face(s) from the gallery that are most similar to the input face. The VisageFaceRecognition class includes a full set of functions for manipulating the gallery, including adding, removing, naming descriptors in the gallery as well as loading and saving the gallery to file.
