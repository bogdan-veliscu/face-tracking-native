<h1>Face Detect Demo sample project</h1>
<p>
The Face Detect Demo sample project demonstrates facial features detection based on the <a href="html/classVisageSDK_1_1VisageFeaturesDetector.html"><em>VisageSDK::FacialFeaturesDetector</em></a> class and face recognition based on the <a href="html/classVisageSDK_1_1VisageFaceRecognition.html"><em>VisageSDK::VisageFaceRecogition</em></a> class.
</p>

<h2>Building and running the project</h2>

<p>
The FaceDetectDemo sample projects is located in the Samples/iOS/FaceDetectDemo sub-folder of the visage|SDK for iOS folder.
</p>
<p>
Prerequisites to running the sample project are installed Xcode (8.3.x) and an iOS device (iPhone 6 or iPad 4 (or newer) recommended). Sample project will also work in the simulator.
</p>
<p>
Project is opened in Xcode by double-clicking on the FaceDetectDemo.xcodeproj project file. To run the project an iOS device first must be attached to the computer and selected as active scheme in Xcode project. The project sample application can than be run by choosing Run option in Xcode.
</p>
</br>

<h2>Using the sample application</h2>
<p>
The sample application consists of a two buttons: Detect and Match faces. Detect button loads an image from the device gallery. If any features were detected, they are drawn on the loaded image and shown on the screen. Match faces button loads an image bundled with the sample application and performs face recognition on it. As a result, name of the recognized person (or the name of the person with the most similar face found in the VisageFaceRecognition gallery) will be drawn on the loaded image and shown on the screen.
Sample images are provided in data/images sub-folder of visage|SDK for iOS folder which can be added to device gallery.
</p>
<p>
	<b> NOTE:</b>  Without the valid license appropriate message will appear and detection results will be shown with a 2 seconds delay and recognition results with an extra 5 seconds delay. 
</p>
</br>
<h2>Implementation overview</h2>
<p>
The visage|SDK API is written in C++ and since development on iOS is done in Objective-C a special way of interfacing the two must be employed. In this sample project this is done through <a href="html/interfaceVisageFeaturesDetectorWrapper.html"><em>VisageFeaturesDetectorWrapper</em></a>  and <a href="html/interfaceVisageFaceRecognitionWrapper.html"><em>VisageFaceRecognitionWrapper</em></a>, Objective-C classes that exposes Objective-C methods for using the detector and recognizer, while the implementation of those methods is done in Objective-C++, a combination of Objective-C and C++.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="html/interfaceVisageTrackerViewController.html"><em>FaceDetectViewController</em></a> (Objective-C class) connects with GUI (that is defined in MainWindow.xib file) and implements actions that calls to methods from <a href="html/interfaceVisageFeaturesDetectorWrapper.html"><em>VisageFeaturesDetectorWrapper</em></a> and <a href="html/interfaceVisageFaceRecognitionWrapper.html"><em>VisageFaceRecognitionWrapper</em></a> classes in order to detect and display facial features altogether with face recognition.
</p>
<p>
The specific classes and methods that demonstrate visage|SDK are:
<ul>
<li><a href="html/interfaceVisageFeaturesDetectorWrapper.html"><em>VisageFeaturesDetectorWrapper</em></a>: Provides the Objective-C interface to main face detector functions.</li>
<li><a href="html/interfaceVisageFaceRecognitionWrapper.html"><em>VisageFaceRecognitionWrapper</em></a>: Provides the Objective-C interface to main face recognition functions.</li>
<li><a href="html/interfaceVisageFeaturesDetectorWrapper.html"><em>VisageFeaturesDetectorWrapper::drawFeatures</em></a>: Method that is used to detect and display the detected features.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Other important classes are:
<ul>
<li><a href="html/interfaceFaceDetectAppDelegate.html"><em>FaceDetectAppDelegate</em></a>: Implements the application delegate.</li>
<li><a href="html/interfaceFaceDetectViewController.html"><em>FaceDetectViewController</em></a>: Implements default view controller and application GUI. This class calls methods that are implemented in VisageFeaturesDetectorWrapper class.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<p>More details about each class is available in documentation for specific class.</p>
<p>Users are free to modify the sample project to test the functionalities of the Facial Features Detector. The sample project also serves as a starting point when creating new projects that will use visage|SDK. </p>
