	/// The tracker returns these main classes of data:
	///  - 3D head pose
	///  - facial expression
	///  - gaze direction
	///  - eye closure
	///  - facial feature points
	///  - full 3D face model, textured

	///  For further details please see the smoothing_factors parameter array in the <a href="../VisageTracker Configuration Manual.pdf">VisageTracker Configuration Manual</a>.

	/// <h2>Returned data</h2>
	/// 
	/// The following sections give an overview of main classes of data that may be returned in FaceData by the tracker or the detector, and pointers to specific data members.
	/// 
	/// <h3>3D head pose</h3>
	/// 
	/// The 3D head pose consists of head translation and rotation. It is available as absolute pose of the head with respect to the camera.
	/// 
	///  The following member variables return the head pose:
	///  - #FaceTranslation
	///  - #FaceRotation 
	/// 
	/// Both face tracker and face detector return the 3D head pose.
	/// 
	/// <h3>Facial expression</h3>
	/// 
	/// Facial expression is available in a form of Action Units (AUs), which describe the basic motions of the face, such as mouth opening, eyebrow raising etc.
	///
	/// AUs are <a href="../VisageTracker Configuration Manual.pdf">fully configurable</a> in the tracker configuration files. For the full list of default AUs, and for other information about the use and configuration of AUs, please refer to the <a href="../VisageTracker Configuration Manual.pdf">Tracker Configuration Manual</a>.
	/// Please note that the AUs are similar, but not identical to the FACS Action Units.
	///
	///  The following member variables return Action Units data:
	///  - #ActionUnitCount
	///  - #ActionUnitsUsed
	///  - #ActionUnits
	///  - #ActionUnitsNames
	///
	///  Only face tracker returns the facial expression; face detector leaves these variables undefined. Furthermore, it is returned only if the au_fitting_model parameter is defined in the configuration file. 
	///  An example of such file is Facial Features Tracker - High.cfg. Please see the <a href="../VisageTracker Configuration Manual.pdf">VisageTracker Configuration Manual</a> for further details.
	///
	///  <h3>Gaze direction and eye closure</h3>
	///
	///  Gaze direction is available in local coordinate system of the person's face or global coordinate system of the camera. Eye closure is available as binary information (OPEN/CLOSED).
	///
	///  The following member variables return gaze direction and eye closure:
	///  - #GazeDirection
	///  - #GazeDirectionGlobal
	///  - #EyeClosure
	///
	///  Both face tracker and face detector return gaze direction and eye closure.
	///
	///  <h3>Facial feature points</h3>
	///
	/// 2D or 3D coordinates of facial feature points, including the ones defined by the <a href="../MPEG-4 FBA Overview.pdf">MPEG-4 FBA standard</a> and some additional points are available.
	/// 
	/// 3D coordinates are available in global coordinate system or relative to the origin of the face (i.e. the point in the centre between the eyes in the input image).
	///
	///  Facial features are available through the following member variables:
	///  - #FeaturePoints3D
	///  - #FeaturePoints3DRelative
	///  - #FeaturePoints2D
	///
	///  Both face tracker and face detector return facial feature points.
	/// 
	///  <h3>3D face model</h3>
	///
	/// The 3D face model is fitted in 3D to the face in the current image/video frame. The model is a single textured 3D triangle mesh. The texture of the model is the current image/video frame.
	/// This means that, when the model is drawn using the correct perspective it exactly recreates the facial part of the image. The correct perspective is defined by camera focal length (#CameraFocus), 
	/// width and height of the input image or the video frame, model rotation (#FaceRotation) and translation (#FaceTranslation).
	///
	/// The 3D face model is fully configurable and can even be replaced by a custom model; it can also be disabled for performance reasons if not required. Please see the <a href="../VisageTracker Configuration Manual.pdf">VisageTracker Configuration Manual</a> for further details. The default model is illustrated in the following image:
	///
	///  \image html "coord3.png" "3D face model"
	///
	///  There are multiple potential uses for the face model. Some ideas include, but are not limited to:
	///  - Draw textured model to achieve face paint or mask effect.
	///  - Draw the 3D face model into the Z buffer to achieve correct occlusion of virtual objects by the head in AR applications.
	///  - Use texture coordinates to cut out the face from the image.
	///  - Draw the 3D face model from a different perspective than the one in the actual video.
	///  - Insert the 3D face model into another video or 3D scene.
	///
	///  The 3D face model is contained in the following members:
	///  - #FaceModelVertexCount
	///  - #FaceModelVertices
	///  - #FaceModelTriangleCount
	///  - #FaceModelTriangles
	///  - #FaceModelTextureCoords
	///
	///  Both face tracker and face detector return the 3D face model, if the mesh_fitting_model parameter in the configuration file is set (see <a href="../VisageTracker Configuration Manual.pdf">VisageTracker Configuration Manual</a> for details).
	///
	///  <h3>Screen space gaze position</h3>
	///  Screen space gaze position is available if the tracker was provided with calibration repository and screen space gaze estimator is working in real time mode. 
	///  Otherwise tracker returns default screen space gaze data. Default gaze position is centre of screen. Default estimator state is off (ScreenSpaceGazeData.inState == 0). Please refer to VisageGazeTracker documentation for instructions on usage of screen space gaze estimator.
	///  
	///   Screen space gaze position is contained in member gazeData.
	/// 
	///   Only face tracker returns screen space gaze position.
