	/** VisageFaceRecognition class contains a face recognition algorithm capable of measuring similarity between human 
	* faces and recognizing a person's identity from frontal facial images (yaw angle approximately from -20 to 20 degrees). 
	*
	* Similarity between two faces is calculated as difference between their face descriptors and returned as a value between 0 (no similarity) and 1 (maximum similarity).
	*
	* The face descriptor is a condensed representation of a face. It is an array of short values. The dimension of the array is obtained using getDescriptorSize() function, from now on in the text referred to as 
	* DESCRIPTOR_SIZE. For any two faces, the distance between descriptors is a measure of their similarity.
	*
	* For the purpose of face recognition, faces are stored in a gallery. The gallery is an array of face descriptors, with a corresponding array of names, 
	* so that the gallery may contain n descriptors and a corresponding name for each descriptor. To perform recognition, the face descriptor extracted from 
	* the input image is then compared with face descriptors from the gallery and the similarity between the input face descriptor and all face descriptors from 
	* the gallery is calculated in order to find the face(s) from the gallery that are most similar to the input face. The VisageFaceRecognition class includes 
	* a full set of functions for manipulating the gallery, including adding, removing, naming descriptors in the gallery as well as loading and saving the gallery to file.
