/**
* Feature points of a face.
* This class is a container for facial feature points as defined by <a href="../MPEG-4 FBA Overview.pdf">MPEG-4 FBA standard</a>, as well as
* some additional feature points. Feature points are identified by their group (for example, feature points of
* the nose constitute their own group) and index. So, for example, the tip of the chin belongs to group 2 and has
* index 1, so it is identified as point 2.1. The identification of all feature points is
* illustrated in the image below:
* \image html "mpeg-4_fba.png" "Facial Feature Points (FP)"
* \image html "half_profile_physical_2d.png" "Visible/Physical contour"
* Groups 2 - 11 contain feature points defined according to the
* MPEG-4 FBA standard,
* and groups 12 and 14 contain additional feature points that are not part of the MPEG-4 standard (12.1, 12.5, 12.6, 12.7, 12.8, 12.9, 12.10, 12.11, 12.12, 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.21, 14.22, 14.23, 14.24, 14.25).
* <h4>Face contour - group 13 and group 15</h4>
*
* Face contour is available in two versions: the visible contour (points 13.1 - 13.17) and the physical contour (points 15.1 - 15.17).
* The physical contour is the set of 16 equally spaced points running from one ear to another, following the outer edge of cheeks and the jaw. 
* Depending on face rotation, points on the physical contour may not always be visible; however, our algorithm maps them on the 3D model of the face and estimates the invisible points. 
* Therefore all points of the physical contour are always available, regardless of their visibility, in both 3D and 2D 
* (featurePoints2D, featurePoints3D, featurePoints3DRelative). The 2D points are obtained by projection from the 3D points, 
* and they may not correspond to the points on the visible contour.
*
* The visible contour is the set of 16 equally spaced points running along the edges of the visible part of the face in the image, 
* starting at the height of ears. Thus, in a frontal face the visible contour runs from one ear, along the jaw and chin, to the other ear; 
* in a semi-profile face it runs from the visible ear, along the jaw and chin, then along the cheek on the far side of the face; 
* in full profile it runs from the ear, along the jaw, then up along the mouth and nose. 
* The points on the visible contour are obtained directly by detection/tracking, and they are available only in 2D (featurePoints2D). 
* Please note that point 13.17 is exactly identical to point 2.1 (2.1 point exists for MPEG-4 compatibility purposes).
*
* <h4>Stability and accuracy of the contours</h4>
*
* The points on the visible contour are among the most difficult to detect/track, and their accuracy is lower than that of eyes or mouth points; 
* they are also more noisy (jittery). The points on the physical contour are obtained from the fitted 3D model of the face. 
* This stabilises them so there is considerably less jitter. In general, it is recommended to use the physical contour.
*
*
* FDP class stores feature point information. It also provides functions for reading and writing the feature point data as files.
*
* The actual data for each feature point is stored in the structure FeaturePoint. One such structure is allocated for each feature point. To
* access a feature point, use one of the functions getFP() that access a feature point by its group and index expressed either as integer values, or as a string (e.g. "2.1").
* Functions getFPPos() are available as a convenience, to access the feature point coordinates directly, without first accessing the FeaturePoint structure.
*
* The feature points may relate to a particular 3D model. In such a case it is interesting to know, for each feature point, to
* which vertex it belongs. For this purpose, the FeaturePoint structure contains the mesh identifier
* and vertex index that correspond to the feature point and the FDP class provides functions to access this data.
*
* <b><i>Left-right convention</i></b>
*
* References to left and right in feature point definitions are given from the perspective of the face itself so "right eye"
* can be imagined as "my right eye". When refering to feature points in an image, it is assumed that image is taken by camera and
* not mirrored so "right eye" is on the left in the image, as shown in feature points illustration above.
