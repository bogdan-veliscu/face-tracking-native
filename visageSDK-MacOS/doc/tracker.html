<h1>Visage Tracker Demo sample project</h1>
<p>
The VisageTrackerDemo sample project demonstrates real-time head / facial features tracking on multiple faces from camera, video file
or image based on the <a href="sdk-html/classVisageSDK_1_1VisageTracker.html"><em>VisageTracker</em></a> tracker class.
</p>

<h2>Building and running the project</h2>

<p>
The VisageTrackerDemo sample application is located in bin subfolder of visage|SDK for Mac OS X folder. To run the sample application double click on VisageTrackerDemo file.
</p>

<p>
The VisageTrackerDemo sample project is located in the Samples/MacOSX/VisageTrackerDemo subfolder of the visage|SDK for Mac OS X folder.
</p>
<p>
Prerequisites to building the sample project are:
<ul>
<li>Xcode (versions 8.3.x)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Project is opened in Xcode by double-clicking on the VisageTrackerDemo.xcodeproj project file. To build the project select Product->Build from menu bar. The project can be run by choosing Run option in
Xcode.
</p>

<h2>Using the sample app</h2>
<p>
    The sample app consists of a  popup control and menu bar containing five menu items: FaceTrackerDemo, File, Tracking, Window and Help.
    <br/>Tracking configuration can be selected from the popup control.
    <br/>To start tracking select Tracking menu item and choose one tracking option: Track from camera, Track from video or Track from image.
    Sample video files can be found in the folder /data/video. In order to use these videos it is necessary to install latest QuickTime player and copy missing codec components from dependencies/Codec_MacOSX to the Library/QuickTime folder.
    <br/>To stop tracking select Tracking menu item and select Stop tracking option.
    <br/>While tracking is running, FPS and tracking status and information is displayed at the bottom of the window.
</p>
</br>

<h2>Implementation overview</h2>
<p>
The visage|SDK API is written in C++ and since development on Mac OS X is done in Objective-C a special way of interfacing
the two must be employed. In this sample project this is done through <td><a href="sdk-html/interfaceTrackerWrapper.html">TrackerWrapper</a></td> Objective-C class that exposes
Objective-C methods for using the tracker, while the implementation of those methods is done in Objective-C++, a
combination of Objective-C and C++.
</p>
<p>
The AppDelegate (Objective-C class) connects with GUI (that is defined in MainWindow.xib file) and
implements actions that call to methods from TrackerWrapper class to start and stop the tracker and display the
tracking results using <a href="sdk-html/interfaceCustomGLView.html">CustomGLView</a> object.
</p>
<p>
The specific classes and methods that demonstrate visage|SDK are:
<ul>
<li><a href="sdk-html/interfaceTrackerWrapper.html">TrackerWrapper</a>: Provides an Objective-C interface to main tracker functions (start, stop, get results); calls <a href="sdk-html/classVisageSDK_1_1VisageRendering.html">VisageRendering::DisplayResults</a> in order to display tracking results.</li>
</br>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Other important classes are:
<ul>
<li> <a href="sdk-html/interfaceAppDelegate.html">AppDelegate</a>: Implements the app delegate.</li>
<li><a href="sdk-html/interfaceCustomGLView.html">CustomGLView</a></td>: Implements OpenGL view for results display.</li>
<li> <td><a href="sdk-html/classOpenGLInterface.html">OpenGLInterface</a></td>: Serves as an adapter for calling Objective-C methods of <td><a href="sdk-html/interfaceCustomGLView.html">CustomGLView</a></td> class from C++. </li>
<li> <td><a href="sdk-html/classGUIInterface.html">GUIInterface</a></td>: Serves as an adapter for calling Objective-C methods of <td><a href="sdk-html/interfaceCustomGLView.html">CustomGLView</a></td> class from C++. </li>
<li> <td><a href="sdk-html/classVisageSDK_1_1VisageRendering.html">VisageRendering</a></td>: Displays the current frame and the following tracking results using OpenGL.</li>
<li> <td><a href="sdk-html/interfaceInformer.html">Informer</a></td>: Class used for displaying tracking information to the user.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
More details about each class is available in documentation for specific class.</br></br>
Users are free to modify the sample project to test the functionalities of the Visage tracker. The sample project also
serves as a starting point when creating new projects that will use visage|SDK.
</p>

<h3>Configuration selection and modification</h3>
<p>
Popup control in the upper left corner of the main window contains all available tracking configuration files. These files are read from the Samples/data folder. The first configuration is selected by default. In order to select desired configuration, simply mark it in the popup control.
</p>
    <p> To edit configuration files go to the folder containing VisageTrackerDemo app (default is bin folder), right click (ctrl + click) on VisageTrackerDemo.App and select "Show Package Contents". Finder will display a folder containing Contents folder. Configuration files are in Contents/Resources folder.
