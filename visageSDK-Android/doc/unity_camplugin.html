<h2>Android Camera Plugin project</h2>

<p>
The AndroidCameraPlugin is Java plugin used for accessing and handling Android camera. It's use is demonstrated in <a href="unity_ar.html">VisageTrackerUnityDemo</a> and <a href="unity_facial.html">FacialAnimationUnityDemo</a> samples.
</p>

<h3>Building the project</h3>

<p>
The files related to Android Camera Plugin project are located in the Samples/Android/AndroidCameraPlugin
sub-folder of the visage|SDK for Android folder.<br/><br/>
Prerequisites to building the sample project are :<br/>
<ul>
  <li>Java JDK (version 8 or higher)</li>
  <li>Android Studio 2.3.2</li>
  <li>Android SDK (version 4.1.2 API or higher)</li>
  <li>Unity (version 5.x)</li>
</ul> 

To build the AndroidCameraPlugin, please follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Open AndroidCameraPlugin project (located in Samples/Android) into Android Studio. </li>
<li>Navigate to folder AndroidCameraPlugin/app/libs and delete existing file classes.jar</li>
<li>Navigate to directoy where Unity is installed and copy file classes.jar (typically located in C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor\Data\PlaybackEngines?\androidplayer\development\bin)</li>
<li>Paste the file to AndroidCameraPlugin/app/libs</li>
<li>Open Gradle on the right and click "Refresh all Gradle projects" under Gradle projects</li>
<li>Under Gradle projects, go to AndroidCameraPlugin -> :app -> Tasks -> other</li>
<li>Double click on task <b>exportJar</b> and AndroidCameraPlugin.jar will be created in the AndroidCameraPlugin/app/release folder</li>
<li>AndroidCameraPlugin.jar and AndroidManifest.xml should be replaced with new versions in Plugins/Android folder of your Unity project.
<br/> <b>NOTE:</b> Package name in AndroidManifest.xml should match the package name in CameraActivity.jar</li>  
</ol>

<h3>Implementation overview</h3>
<p>
Project is used for handling camera on Android. This is realised as Android activity which is created from C# script in Unity when the application starts. Switching between front and back facing camera is done by calling Android activity's functions from Unity script. </br> <a href="unity_plugin.html">VisageTrackerUnityPlugin</a> provides Java interface to events such as sending frames from camera to tracker and camera parameters changes.
</br> AndroidCameraPlugin source code is available <a href="html/CameraActivity_8java_source.html"><em>here</em></a>.
